# Self-Healing Selenium .NET Framework

A robust Selenium automation framework for .NET that leverages AI-powered self-healing locators to automatically recover from web element identification failures. This framework uses OpenAI's GPT models to intelligently generate alternative locators when original ones fail, making your tests more resilient to UI changes.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Self-Healing Locators**: Automatically recovers from locator failures using AI-generated alternatives
- **Intelligent Caching**: Reduces API costs by caching successful locator mappings
- **Flexible Execution Modes**: Control whether tests fail with suggestions or continue running
- **SpecFlow Integration**: Built-in support for BDD testing with Gherkin syntax
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging with Serilog for debugging and monitoring
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Works with Chrome, Firefox, and other Selenium-supported browsers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The framework consists of two main projects:

- **`framework`**: Core framework library containing self-healing logic, page objects, and utilities
- **`tests`**: Test project with SpecFlow feature files, step definitions, and test configurations

## üß† How Self-Healing Locators Work

### Core Implementation

The self-healing mechanism is implemented in the `SmartLocatorGenerator` class, which:

1. **Detects Locator Failures**: When a locator fails to find an element, the framework captures the current page state
2. **Analyzes Context**: Extracts the accessibility tree and relevant HTML snippets from the page
3. **AI-Powered Generation**: Sends the context to OpenAI's GPT model with a specialized prompt to generate a new locator
4. **Validation & Caching**: Validates the generated locator and caches successful mappings for future use

### Performance Optimization

The framework employs several optimization techniques to reduce API costs and improve response times:

#### HTML Context Optimization with `GetRelevantHtmlSnippets()`

Instead of sending the complete page source to the AI model, the framework uses `GetRelevantHtmlSnippets()` to extract only the most relevant portions of the HTML:

- **Targeted Extraction**: Identifies and extracts HTML sections most likely to contain the target element
- **Size Reduction**: Significantly reduces the payload sent to the AI model, lowering API costs
- **Improved Accuracy**: Provides focused context that helps the AI generate better locators
- **Faster Processing**: Smaller payloads result in faster API responses

**How it works:**

```csharp
var relevantPageSource = driver.GetRelevantHtmlSnippets();
var combinedPageSource = string.Join("\n", relevantPageSource);
```

This approach can be adjusted based on your specific needs:

- For complex pages, you might need to include more HTML sections
- For simple pages, you can further reduce the context size
- The extraction logic can be customized to focus on specific DOM regions

#### Intelligent Caching System

The framework implements a sophisticated caching mechanism to minimize repeated AI API calls:

**Cache Benefits:**

- **API Cost Reduction**: Avoids repeated AI inference calls for the same locator failures
- **Faster Execution**: Cached locators are retrieved instantly without API delays
- **Consistent Results**: Ensures the same alternative locator is used across test runs
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes outdated cache entries (default: 2 days) to prevent stale locators

**Cache Structure:**

```json
{
  "#login-button": {
    "originalLocator": "#login-button",
    "generatedLocator": "//button[@id='login-btn']",
    "strategy": "XPATH",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-28T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Cache Management:**

The framework automatically:

- Loads cache on startup from the configured `cachePath`
- Saves new mappings after successful locator generation
- Cleans up entries older than 2 days (configurable)
- Provides cache statistics for monitoring

**Combined Optimization Impact:**

- **HTML Context Optimization**: 60-80% reduction in API payload size
- **Intelligent Caching**: Up to 90% reduction in API calls for recurring failures
- **Overall Cost Savings**: Combined techniques can reduce AI API costs by 85-95% in mature test suites

### AI Prompt Strategy

The framework uses a sophisticated prompt that instructs the AI to:

- Analyze the accessibility tree to identify the target element
- Cross-reference with HTML source code
- Prioritize stable attributes over dynamic ones
- Generate robust XPath or CSS selectors
- Return structured JSON responses with locator and strategy

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The framework is configured through `testsettings.json` in the tests project. Key self-healing configurations include:

### Core Self-Healing Settings

```json
{
  "useSmartLocator": "false",
  "runWithSmartLocator": "false", 
  "cachePath": "cache\\locator_cache.json",
  "openApiModel": "gpt-4.1-nano",
  "openApiKey": "<set this api key in environment or here>"
}
```

#### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `useSmartLocator` | Enables/disables the self-healing locator feature | `false` |
| `runWithSmartLocator` | Controls test execution behavior when locators fail | `false` |
| `cachePath` | Path to store cached locator mappings | `cache\locator_cache.json` |
| `openApiModel` | OpenAI model to use for locator generation | `gpt-4.1-nano` |
| `openApiKey` | OpenAI API key (can be set via environment variable) | - |

### Execution Modes

#### 1. Smart Locator Discovery Mode (`runWithSmartLocator: false`)

- **Behavior**: When a locator fails, generates an alternative but **fails the test** with a detailed message
- **Use Case**: During test development and maintenance to identify broken locators
- **Output**: Shows both old and new locators for manual review and test updates

```text
Locator has been changed from 
Old: #old-button-id
New: //button[contains(text(), 'Submit')]
Please review the same and update the test or create bug
```

#### 2. Self-Healing Mode (`runWithSmartLocator: true`)

- **Behavior**: Automatically uses the generated locator and **continues test execution**
- **Use Case**: Production test runs where continuity is prioritized
- **Output**: Logs the successful locator replacement and continues testing

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd self-healing-selenium-dot-net
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Configure settings**
   - Update `src/tests/testsettings.json` with your OpenAI API key
   - Set `useSmartLocator: "true"` to enable self-healing
   - Configure other settings as needed

4. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   dotnet test src/tests/tests.csproj
   ```

### Example Usage

```csharp
public class LoginPage(IWebDriver driver)
{
    private readonly By _loginButton = By.Id("login-button");
    private readonly By _usernameInput = By.Id("user-name");
    
    public void DoLogin(string userName, string password)
    {
        // These methods automatically use self-healing locators
        _driver.DoClearAndSendKeys(_usernameInput, userName);
        _driver.DoClick(_loginButton);
    }
}
```

The framework extends WebDriver with methods like `DoClick()`, `DoClearAndSendKeys()`, and `DoCheckIfExists()` that automatically invoke the self-healing mechanism when locators fail.

## üß™ Sample Tests

The repository includes sample tests for the SauceDemo application:

```gherkin
Feature: Saucedemo Login
    Scenario: Valid login should take to inventory page
        Given the user is on login page
        When the user logged in with username and password
        Then the user is navigated to Inventory Page
```

## üìä Monitoring and Debugging

### Logging

The framework uses Serilog for comprehensive logging:

- Smart locator generation attempts
- Cache hits and misses
- API call details
- Error diagnostics

### Cache Statistics

Monitor cache performance with built-in statistics:

```csharp
var stats = SmartLocatorGenerator.GetCacheStatistics();
// Returns: TotalEntries, OldestEntry, NewestEntry
```
